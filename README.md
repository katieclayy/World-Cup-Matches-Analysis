# World-Cup-Matches-Analysis

## Introduction
The FIFA World Cup is a highly anticipated international soccer tournament held every four years. It brings together 32 of the world’s top men’s national teams from different countries. The teams are divided into eight groups (Group A to H) and contain four teams in each group. The tournament structure involves group stages followed by knockout rounds. The teams compete for the World Cup title over a month-long tournament. This project will analyze a dataset of the FIFA World Cup and lead to discovering key metrics.

## Data Content:
•	WorldCupMatches – match statistics for every season

## Goals of this project:
1.) Was there a specific referee that had the away team advantage?

2.) Which are the top 5 countries who have won the greatest number of FIFA World Cups? Create visuals for the findings.

3.) How many goals were scored each season? What percentage of total goals were scored by the winning team in each season? Create visuals for the findings.

4.) How many cards (Red/Yellow) were issued in each season? Which team was issued the highest number of cards in a season?

4b.) Is there a correlation between the number of yellow cards issued to a team in a match with the number of goals scored by the team in that match?
