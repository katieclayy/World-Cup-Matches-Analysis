# World-Cup-Matches-Analysis

## Introduction
The FIFA World Cup is a highly anticipated international soccer tournament held every four years. It brings together 32 of the world’s top men’s national teams from different countries. The teams are divided into eight groups (Group A to H) and contain four teams in each group. The tournament structure involves group stages followed by knockout rounds. The teams compete for the World Cup title over a month-long tournament. This project will analyze a dataset of the FIFA World Cup and lead to discovering key metrics.

## Goals of this project:
1.) Which are the top 5 countries who have won the greatest number of FIFA World Cups? Create visuals for the findings.
